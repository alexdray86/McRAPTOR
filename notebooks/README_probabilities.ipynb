To match both datasets, we matched `stop_id` , `departure_time` and `arrival_time` (with a join) to get corresponding trip_id on the same line. The idea is to take every trip_id with more than X matches between the two datasets. We decided to use 2 as a minimum number of matches needed. _Note : with a threshold > 2 we were not able to get InterCity / InterRegio trains, which have very few stops in the 15km perimeter._\n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to compute the probability of success of a given transfert, we use the arrival delay distribution compared with the next trip departure. To be able to do that, we need delay distributions for each trip arrival to a given station. We then use a __cumulative distribution function__ to compute $P(X \\leq x)$ :\n",

    "#### Recover missing data \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we cannot find a clear match for a given `trip_id` x `stop_id`, we use aggregated delay distributions from similar transfer, on which we used the same CDF function abovementionned. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recover missing or faulty data, the strategy is the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we have more than 100 data points in `real` group, we rely exclusively on its delay distribution to compute probabilities for a given transfer on a `trip_id x stop_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note : `real` group corresponds to arrival time with status `geschaetz` or `real`, meaning it comes from actual measurments._\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we do not find enough data within `real` group, we use delay distributions in `all` group (contains all delays including `prognose` status), if there is more than 100 data points for a given `trip_id x stop_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If `all` group still does not have more than 100 data points, we rely on `recovery tables` to estimate delay distributions. The strategy is the following :\n",
    "    - As we will always know the `stop_id`, the `time` and the `transport_type`, we rely on arrival delays from aggregated values of similar transfer. \n",
    "        - First, we compute a table of distribution with all possible combination of `stop_id`, `time` (round to hours) and `transport_type`, and aggregate all the counts we have to compute cumulative distribution probabilities. \n",
    "        - Is there is less than 100 data points in one of these intersections, we use the last possibilities : a table with `transport_type` x `time` aggregate counts.\n",
    "        - The last values with no match are given the overall average of cumulative distribution probabilities for each `transport_type` with no limit for the minimum number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this approach, we can find cumulative distribution probabilities for every combination of `trip_id x stop_id` as defined in `stop_times_df`. We will make a table with the same row order so that McRaptor can easily find their indexes. "
