    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn the RAPTOR algorithm by coding it for a toy example with the data structures advised in the paper. We code RAPTOR for a super simple toy example with only two routes and two trips each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Toy example\n",
    "- TODO updates:\n",
    "    - additional route r2 that goes from A to E slowly\n",

    "\n",
    "## Encoding the data structures\n",
    "### General considerations\n",
    "We adhere to the data structures proposed by Delling et al. These structures aim to minimize read times in memory by making use of consecutive in-memory adresses. Thus, structures with varying dimensions (e.g dataframes, python lists) are excluded. We illustrate the difficulty with an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each route has a potentially unique number of stops. Therefore, we cannot store stops in a 2D array of routes by stops, as the number of stops is not the same for each route. We adress this problem by storing stops consecutively by route, and keeping track of the index of the first stop for each route.\n",
    "\n",
    "This general strategy is applied to all the required data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### routes\n",
    "The `routes` array will contain arrays `[n_trips, n_stops, pt_1st_stop, pt_1st_trip]` where all four values are `int`. To avoid overcomplicating things and try to mimic pointers in python, `pt_1st_stop` and `pt_1st_trip` contain integer indices."

We retrieve the index of the first (earliest) trip of the route with the pointer `pt_1st_trip` stored in `routes`. We may use the built-in `numpy` [date and time data structures](https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-work-with-dates-and-times-in-python/). In short, declaring dates and times is done like this: `np.datetime64('YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm')`. Entries with a `NaT` arrival or departure times correspond to beginning and end of trips respectively.\n",
